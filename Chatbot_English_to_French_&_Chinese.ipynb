            "3. Machine learning: Machine learning is a key component of AI. It involves training an AI model using the preprocessed data. The model is fed with input data and learns from the patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions or classifications.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Algorithms: Various algorithms are used within machine learning to enable the AI model to learn and make decisions. These algorithms can be based on statistical techniques, neural networks, or other mathematical models.\n",

            "6. Natural language processing: AI systems can be equipped with natural language processing capabilities, allowing them to understand and respond to human language. This involves tasks like speech recognition, language translation, and sentiment analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Decision-making: AI models generate outputs based on the data they are trained on. These outputs can include making predictions, providing recommendations, or solving problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Iterative improvement: AI systems often go through a feedback loop where they continuously learn and improve based on new data and user feedback. This iterative process helps refine the AI model and enhance its performance.\n",
